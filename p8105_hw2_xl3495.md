## Description

So far, the dataset contains 19 variables:

`line`: `<chr>`, describes the line setting;  
`station_name`: `<chr>`, describes the name of the station;  
`station_latitude` & `station_longitude`: `<dbl>`, describe the location
of the station;  
`route1`–`route11`: `<chr>`, describe how many and what routes are going
to pass the station;  
`entrance_type`: `<chr>`, describes the way to enter;  
`entry`: `<lgl>`, describes whether the entry is in use;  
`vending`: `<chr>`, describes whether there is a vending machine;  
`ada`: `<lgl>`, describes whether there is an ADA compliance.

I cleaned this dataset by 4 steps so far.  
1. Read the dataset and substitute all possible blank values using `NA`.
2. Convert all variable names to lowercase with underline substituting
blank space. 3. Select all required columns using `select()` function.
4. Inside `mutate()` function, convert `entry` variable type from
`<chr>` to `<lgl>` by setting ‘YES’ to `TRUE`, ‘NO’ to `FALSE` using
`case_match()` function.

``` r
col = ncol(nyc_subway_df)
row = nrow(nyc_subway_df)
```

Now the dataset is cleaned to 1868 . But it’s not tidy enough since
there exists some repeated rows and columns from `route1` to `route11`
are multifarious and redundant to read.

``` r
num_stations = nrow(distinct(nyc_subway_df, line, station_name))
num_ada = nrow(filter(nyc_subway_df, ada == TRUE) |>
                 distinct(line, station_name))
num_entrance = nrow(filter(nyc_subway_df, vending == "NO") |>
                      filter(entry == TRUE) |>
                      distinct(line, station_name))
proportion_entrance = num_entrance/num_stations*100
proportion_entrance = paste(format(proportion_entrance, nsmall = 2), "%")
```

In total, there are 465 distinct stations, and 84 of them are ADA
compliant, and 9.247312 % of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance.

``` r
A_df = nyc_subway_df |>
  mutate(
    across(route1:route11, ~ as.character(.))
  ) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = route1:route11,
                    names_to = "route_names",
                    values_to = "route_numbers") |>
  filter(route_numbers == "A")
  
num_A_stations = A_df |>
  distinct(line, station_name) |>
  nrow()

num_A_ada = A_df |>
  filter(ada == TRUE) |>
  distinct(line, station_name) |>
  nrow()
```

From above, 60 distinct stations serve the A train. Of the stations that
serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

# Problem 2

``` r
trash_wheel_df = 
  read_excel("datasets/202409\ Trash\ Wheel\ Collection\ Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel" , skip = 1, n_max = 651) |>

gwynnda_trash_wheel_df = 
  read_excel("datasets/202409\ Trash\ Wheel\ Collection\ Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel" , skip = 1, n_max = 264) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  filter(is.na(dumpster) == FALSE)

  mutate(trash_wheel = 
           paste("mr", as.character(dumpster), sep = "_")) |>
  mutate(year = as.double(year)) |>
  relocate(trash_wheel) |>
  select(-dumpster)

prof_df = prof_trash_wheel_df |> 
  mutate(trash_wheel = 
           paste("prof", as.character(dumpster), sep = "_")) |>
  relocate(trash_wheel) |>
  select(-dumpster)

gwynnda_df = gwynnda_trash_wheel_df |>
  mutate(trash_wheel = 
           paste("gwynnda", as.character(dumpster), sep = "_")) |>
  relocate(trash_wheel) |>
  select(-dumpster)

combined_df = bind_rows(mr_df, prof_df, gwynnda_df) |>
  select(-month, -year, -x15, -x16)

size = nrow(combined_df)
```

## Description

In total, there are 1032 observations of data. This combined dataframe
contains three kinds of `trash_wheel`s, which are obtained from
`Mr._Trash_Wheel` (mr\_), `Professor_Trash_Wheel` (prof\_),
`Gwynnda_Trash_Wheel` (gwynnda\_), and after the underline is the
machine number of each kind of Trash Wheel. I deleted `month` and `year`
and preserved `date` to show the time of data collected. There are
several variables describe the general ability of each trash wheel,
including how many tons of trash it has handled, how much space of these
trash take. Remaining variables like `plastic_bottles`, `polystyrene`
etc. are trash types.`homes_powered` shows how much energy it consumed
(not sure). I also removed the `x15` and `x16` column since they contain
no values, showing `NA`.  
Take the first row as an example, `Mr. Trash Wheel -- dumpster 1` has
dealt with 4.31 tons of trash until 2014-05-16, which takes 18 cubic
yards. Among the trash, 1450 are plastic bottles, 72 are glass bottles,
etc (here I didn’t include all trash types). No power was recorded.

``` r
prof_weight = prof_df |>
  select(weight_tons)
prof_weight_trash = sum(prof_weight, na.rm = TRUE)

gwynnda_cigarette = 
  gwynnda_trash_wheel_df |>
  filter(month == "June", year == "2022") |>
  select(cigarette_butts)
num_gwynnda_cigarette = sum(gwynnda_cigarette, na.rm = TRUE)
```

From above, the total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel
is 246.74. The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in
June of 2022 is 1.812^{4}.
